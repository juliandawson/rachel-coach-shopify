It's a conversation to help you discover and deal with anything that stands in your way (including yourself). Coaching increases your self-awareness and planning power so you can use your unique strengths to get what you want.<\/p><p>You bring the topic. I'll ask the questions you haven't thought of yet or challenge you with the ones you don't want to ask. Together, we'll get you where you want to go. Everyone can benefit from coaching; as long as you're open to it and ready to do the work, coaching is for you.<\/p>",

We work as a team.<\/p><p>You're unique, and your coaching sessions will be too. We'll work together to find the approach that helps you get the most out of your coaching sessions.<\/p><p>As a coaching psychologist with a background in project delivery, I bring a toolbox that is jam-packed with a wide range of evidence-based psychological and career models to help you make sense of what’s happening right now and what you want next as well as rigorous planning tools to help you get there.<\/p><p>I believe creative activities boost learning and development; doing something a bit different helps us think differently and see something we couldn't before. I’m a big fan of getting things out of your head and onto paper to help you (quite literally) see things differently. I actively encourage playful experimentation both in and between sessions.<\/p><p>My coaching has been described as being ‘somewhere between a playground and a bootcamp!’ I dig deep to raise awareness of the things you carry into work so you can plan effectively for what you want in your career. Expect an explorative and deep journey with plenty of hard work and fun along the way. <\/p>",
